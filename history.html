      <h2>1889: Nintendo's Humble Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        Nintendo was founded in <strong>1889</strong> by Fusajiro Yamauchi in
        Kyoto, Japan. It started as a company producing handmade
        <em>Hanafuda</em> playing cards, which were popular for gambling and
        entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For decades, Nintendo remained focused on card games, eventually
        becoming a household name in Japan.
      </p>

      <h2>1950s: Expansion and Western Influence</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1950s, Nintendo expanded its card business by partnering with
        companies like <strong>Disney</strong>, printing characters like Mickey
        Mouse on their cards to appeal to younger audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        This marked the beginning of Nintendo’s creative approach to family
        entertainment.
      </p>

      <h2>1960s: Moving into Toys</h2>
      <p>
        During the 1960s, Nintendo moved beyond playing cards into toys and
        novelty products. This was a period of experimentation with items like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ultra Hand</strong> (1966) – An extendable toy hand that was a
          commercial success.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Love Tester</strong> (1969) – A quirky device that "measured"
          love between two people.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This creative spirit laid the foundation for Nintendo’s focus on fun and
        innovative entertainment.
      </p>

      <h2>1970s: Stepping into Electronics</h2>
      <p>
        By the 1970s, Nintendo embraced electronics and arcade games. Key
        milestones include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1973:</strong> Nintendo released its first laser clay shooting
          systems, a precursor to their interactive entertainment systems.

          <strong>1977:</strong> The <strong>Color TV-Game</strong> series
          launched in Japan, marking Nintendo's entry into the home console
          market.

        <li>
          <strong>1979:</strong> Gunpei Yokoi introduced handheld games, leading
          to the creation of the <strong>Game & Watch</strong> series.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The Game & Watch line was a hit, combining portability with gaming and
        laying the groundwork for future handheld systems.
      </p>

      <h2>1981: Donkey Kong and the Birth of Mario</h2>
      <p>
        Nintendo hit the global stage with the release of
        <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> in arcades. The game introduced two icons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donkey Kong</strong> – The game’s villain.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Jumpman</strong> – Later renamed <strong>Mario</strong>, he
          became Nintendo's mascot and the face of the company.
        </li>

      <p>

        <strong>Family Computer (Famicom)</strong> in Japan. It was a home
        console that could play cartridge-based games.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1985, Nintendo released the Famicom internationally as the
        <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</strong>. The NES
        revitalized the video game industry in North America after the crash of
        1983.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iconic games like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and
        <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> became household staples, turning Nintendo
        into a gaming juggernaut.
